This is Task no. 1:
 
Regular Polygon
Regular Polygon is a shape with the 3 or more sides. each side must be equal in length. formula for calculating area is different based on the number of sides.
Square area = length of side * length of side;
Triangle = length of side * length of side * sqrt(3) / 4
Your task is to create a console application in C# that calculates the area of Square, Triangle and Pentagon with appropriate test cases. Your program should be designed in such a way that in future adding a new regular polygon in the system must be easier. Program should be 100% testable and must follow OOD principles.
